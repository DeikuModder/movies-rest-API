# MVC Architecture

MVC stands for Model, View, Controller, the goal of this architecture it's to separate the logic of an application

# Model

The model has the responsability to give shape to the data that will sent and receive to the controller, goal it's to keep the logic of the model inside of it

# Controller

Has the responsability to control the shape that the model gave to the data, controller has to validate that the information it's correct before sending it to the view

# View
